Things have gotten a lot easier since the last time I rebooted my blog. Years ago, I used MovableType and it involved many hours of work importing from other blogs, hacking changes into the Perl backend, messing with .htaccess. This time, I'm starting fresh with the fantastic [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) project for GitHub Pages and editing using the [prose.io](http://prose.io/) authoring tool. I'm really impressed with how smoothly it all works.
