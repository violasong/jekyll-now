Things have gotten a lot easier since the last time I rebooted my blog. Back then when I was using MovableType, starting a blog involved hours of work hacking changes into the Perl backend and messing with .htaccess. This time, I'm using the fabulous [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) project with GitHub Pages and editing using the [prose.io](http://prose.io/) authoring tool, and I'm really impressed with how smoothly it all works.
