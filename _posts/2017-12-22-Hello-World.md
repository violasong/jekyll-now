Dang. Things have gotten a lot easier since the last time I rebooted my blog. Years ago when I used MovableType, blog-making involved many hours of work importing from other blogs, mucking around in MySQL, hacking changes into the Perl backend, and messing with .htaccess. This time, I'm starting fresh with the fantastic [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) project for GitHub Pages, and I'm editing this using the [prose.io](http://prose.io/) authoring tool. I'm really impressed with how smoothly it all works.

I find posting writings on the internet to be really challenging â€” I often agonize over how to word a 140-character tweet. It's weird to put oneself out there on a medium that feels so permanent and widely accessible. I was grateful for the recent opportunity to blog for work with this [Firefox Nightly post](https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2017/09/11/developer-tools-visual-refresh-coming-to-nightly/) about my DevTools refresh. Some more writing about design may be fun, but I mainly hope to discuss some of the ideas I listed in my existing [personal site](https://victoria.neocities.org/).
