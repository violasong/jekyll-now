Things have gotten a lot easier since the last time I rebooted my blog. Years ago, I used MovableType and it involved many hours of work importing from other blogs, mucking around in MySQL, hacking changes into the Perl backend, and messing with .htaccess. This time, I'm starting fresh with the fantastic [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) project for GitHub Pages, and editing this using the [prose.io](http://prose.io/) authoring tool. I'm really impressed with how smoothly it all works.

This fall I wrote a [post](https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2017/09/11/developer-tools-visual-refresh-coming-to-nightly/) on the Firefox Nightly blog about some of my DevTools design work, and while it was surprisingly difficult, it was fun too.
