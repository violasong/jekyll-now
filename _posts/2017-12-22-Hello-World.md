Things have gotten a lot easier since the last time I rebooted my blog. Years ago, I used MovableType and it involved many hours of work importing from other blogs, mucking around in MySQL, hacking changes into the Perl backend, and messing with .htaccess. This time, I'm starting fresh with the fantastic [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) project for GitHub Pages, and editing this using the [prose.io](http://prose.io/) authoring tool. I'm really impressed with how smoothly it all works.

I find writing publicly to be really challenging - I often agonize over how to word a 140-character tweet. It's weird to put oneself out there on the web, a medium so permanent and widely accessible. I was grateful for the recent opportunity to blog for work with this [Firefox Nightly post](https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2017/09/11/developer-tools-visual-refresh-coming-to-nightly/) about some of my DevTools design work.
