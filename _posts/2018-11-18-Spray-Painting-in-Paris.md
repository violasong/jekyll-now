title: Spray Painting at the Skatepark de Bercy

On a trip to Paris this October, two friends and I signed up for a street art lesson on creating a spray paint mural in a place where it’s legal. The instructor had to cancel last minute, but it took only a second for one of us to suggest winging it ourselves. We went to a hardware store and each bought 3 paints to share - orange, green, purple for me, black, white, blush for Kristen, and magenta, gold, blue for Catherine. When then walked to the skatepark mentioned in the class description.

We found the park with noisy skateboarding metal and concrete structures covered in countless layers of spray paint. At first we were concerned about how out in the open it was, with lots of people and families strolling by—none of us had done something like this before and it was unclear where we could definitely spray without running into any trouble. We spent like an hour being too scared do anything. (I googled this question hoping to find a blog post explaining the situation, and found none, hence my blogging about this now.) Thankfully, there was a mural instructor arrived to give someone else lessons, and he confirmed that the whole place was legal and safe to spray. Spray we did for the next 2 hours.

My friends’ interpretation of my painting was that it was a firey volcano woman emerging thunderously from a mountain, a feminist statement like the portraits they made. I appreciated how this fit in between Catherine’s bold pop self-portrait and Kristen’s cubist collection of femme faces. I didn’t have the heart to share my own less positive interpretation. Being on an adventure with friends in one of the most romantic cities was a weird place to be sad.

Nevertheless, it was a highlight of my art-making life, and now I can’t wait to find a legal place to do this in Portland. Next time I’ll be more prepared - the tainted lungs and cramped forearms were a funny part of this experience, but it’ll be great to have a face mask and a grip-style spray can holder next time! Gloves as before are vital for me as I can’t help using my hands in a painting, I want to get the special caps for slower flow, as I had run out of paint in my heavy application, and some kind of stenciling material would be fun to experiment with. The neon colors I chose this time were a bit weird for me so next time I’ll have primary colors and more neutral shades ready.

I’m certain there are multiple layers of paint on top of my painting now, but just the knowledge that mine is underneath is enough.
